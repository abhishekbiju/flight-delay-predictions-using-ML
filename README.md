# flight-delay-predictions-using-ML
A research report on flight delay predictions using various Machine Learning algorithms
- Explored an independent research project that tackled building real-time deployable Machine Learning Algorithms to accurately predict flight delays from flight operations data.
- Implemented, deployed, and compared various machine-learning algorithms through Scikit-Learn and Pandas in Python spanning Gradient-Boosted and Random Forest Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes classifiers, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks achieving a top prediction accuracy of 96.7%.
- Outlined the entire procedure from the exploratory data analysis, feature extraction, and feasibility analysis to performance calibration and model deployment.
